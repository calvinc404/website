    Salvation is a large term, that is, it contains a number of acts performed by God. It is one word which encompasses a number of components. Scripture explains salvation, as well as the sub-components which are part of salvation, giving us a rich understanding of salvation. Moreover, salvation can be considered a large term because it bears a strange relation to time: we both are/have been saved (Luke 7:50, Rom 8:24, Eph 2:8 - it’s a done deal) and are being saved (1 Cor 1:18, 2 Cor 2:15 - it’s ongoing).
</p>
<p>
    You can be saved without understanding salvation in detail. Indeed, many faithful Christians who have been saved for decades know only that salvation is of God and comes by faith in Jesus Christ.  I strongly suspect there are more than a few preachers, and even pastors, who do not fully grasp salvation (or, rather, the fancy terms I’ll talk about here).  Many of these saints will even pass on to eternal life knowing only that salvation has given them the assurance that earthly death is but a doorway to eternal life with God.  That's OK. Absolutely nothing is wrong with the Christian who has a "simple" view of salvation.  And I must quickly point out that even though I’ll be bouncing around all these fancy terms like “justification” and “sanctification”, I am 1) still learning, and 2) fully convinced that I will never TOTALLY get all of what being saved means.  That’s OK.  The Lord Jesus Christ has saved me, and all the rest that I do understand is gravy.  No, make that icing.  I like cake.

    If you are not saved, that's a situation you should correct now. Here's how: 
    <ul>
        <li>Know and admit that you are a sinner according to the only standard that matters - God's. Realize that you have offended God and repent of this offense.</li>
        <li>Realize and believe that God has given His Son, Jesus Christ, as the sacrifice for your sin and the means to become righteous in His sight. Accept Jesus' sacrifice on your behalf and the salvation He has provided for you. Submit to Jesus’ lordship and control over your life.</li>
        <li>Confess to the Lord - that is, pray to Him - that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and that you accept His rule over you.</li>
    </ul>
    There are a few Scriptures where this is expounded on, but a quick read should be Romans 10:9-10. Now, if you've sincerely and honestly done this, YOU ARE SAVED! Yay!
</p>
<p>
    The rest of this article goes into detail about the "components" of salvation and other ideas closely related to salvation. If this gets heady or confusing to you, skip it. Understanding all this stuff explains a lot about your salvation, but is not required to be saved.
</p>
<p>
    <h5>What is salvation?  What have you been saved from?  (a partial list)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Deliverance from sin (Matt 1:21, 1 John 3:5) </li>
        <li>Uncleanness (Ezek 36:29)</li>
        <li>Bondage to the devil and to sin (Rom 6:6, 20, Col 2:15, Heb 2:14-15)</li>
        <li>Wrath (Rom 5:9, 1 Thes 1:10)</li>
        <li>Eternal death and condemnation (John 3:16-18)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Repentance of sin is required in order to be saved.
    <i>Isa 55:7,  Acts 2:38,  3:19, Rom 2:4, 2 Cor 7:10</i>
</p>
<p>
    Salvation provides reconciliation with God.
    <i>Rom 5:10-11, 2 Cor 5:18-19, Eph 2:13-16, Col 1:20-22</i>
</p>
<p>
    We are able to obtain salvation because Jesus redeemed us. He bought (purchased) us from the dominion and captivity (slavery) of sin. The price Jesus paid was His blood and His death. The point of purchase was the cross. It is because of and through this redemption that we may obtain salvation through Him. Some of the benefits of Jesus' redemption, and some of the consequences of our salvation, are yet to come. See Eph 1:7, 1:13-14 and 4:30. This partially explains that we have been saved and that we are being saved.
    <i>Matt 20:28, Acts 20:28, 1 Cor 1:30, 6:20, Gal 3:13, 4:3-5, Titus 2:14, Heb 9:12-15, 1 Pet 1:18—19</i>
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Justification</u></b> is God's declaration that the saved believer is righteous (by His own standard - the only one that matters).  It's sort of like a judge finding and declaring you not guilty, in fact a full explanation of justification has many parallels to a court process. We are immediately justified (that is, declared righteous) when we are saved; it is not a process.
    <i>John 5:24, Acts 13:38-89, Rom 3:23-26, 5:1,  1 Cor 6:11,  Gal  2:16,  Titus 3:4-7</i>
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Regeneration</u></b> is the reforming of a believer into the image of Christ. Being born again is the beginning of regeneration. Regeneration transforms the "old man" into the "new man." This part of salvation, the act of regeneration, is strictly an act of God. Man, on his own, cannot effect regeneration, he cannot on his own conform to the image of Christ.
    <i>John 3:3, Rom 6:10-11, 2 Cor 3:18, 5:17, Col 3:9-10, Titus 3:4-7</i>
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Sanctification</u></b> is a major part of salvation. In the Old Testament, sanctification almost exclusively meant to consecrate or set apart something to/for God alone. This meaning was not lost in the New Testament. In the New Testament (with the new covenant mediated by Christ), sanctification additionally becomes the process of purification / the process of being made holy. The Holy Spirit is the agent of sanctification in us, and His purpose is to purify us, to make us holy, and to consecrate us to God. There is a sense in which we are instantly sanctified when we become saved and a sense in which sanctification is progressive. The progressive sense of sanctification is driven by the Holy Spirit, but we also have a part to play. Phil 2:12-13 refers to “working out your own salvation” and states that “it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” This speaks of us having an active part in our sanctification, even though the process is led by God working in us.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that I am providing only a quick explanation here. The sanctification of the believer is a rich subject with many nuances. It is worthy of in-depth study, but these notes will end our discussion of sanctification at this point.
    <i>John 17:17-19, Rom 6:10-11, 1 Cor 1:30, 6:11, 2 Cor 6:17, 7:1, Eph 4:20-24, Phil 2:12-13, Col 3:8-10, 1 Thes 4:3-7, 2 Thes 2:13, Titus 2:11-14, Heb 2:11, 10:10-14, 12:14, 13:12, 1 Pet 1:15-16, 1 John 3:3</i>
</p>
<p>
    The culmination of our regeneration and sanctification is pure conformity to the image of Christ, which Scripture calls <b><u>glorification</u></b>. The believer will be glorified; we move toward and eagerly await being glorified with Christ, while becoming more like Him each day (through regeneration and sanctification). We will not be glorified in this lifetime. Indeed we cannot be glorified with Christ in this lifetime. We need glorified bodies, we need to be totally free of the flesh, spiritually and physically.
    <i>Rom 8:17, 23-24, 29-30, 1 Cor 15:50-53, Phil 3:21, 1 John 3:2-3</i>
</p>

    <h5><u>Once saved, always saved?  Can a person lose his salvation?</u></h5>
    I believe that a truly saved person always remains so (note that this is a my belief; it can be debated). One who has truly repented and truly accepted Christ as Savior and Lord cannot lose their salvation. As proof, I offer the following Scripture:
    <i>John 5:24, 6:37, Rom 8:29, 1 Cor 3:11-15, Eph 1:4-6,11, 2 Tim 1:9, 1 John 2:28</i>
</p>
<p>
    I want to say a few things about the idea of a person losing his salvation, however. I view the very question ”can I lose my salvation?“ as dangerous. I think that asking if your salvation can be lost is masking a heart that was not sincere when you ”accepted Jesus.” I think someone in this position needs to ask themselves instead if they are truly prepared to submit to God, to accept Jesus as Lord over their life (2 Cor 13:5).  Another possibility is that a truly repentant, saved and converted person has true fears that he may ”slip up” and lose his salvation. I don't think this happens often with the truly saved (I've got nothing to back this up, I just don't).  If you are truly saved, saint, be assured that you cannot slip up badly enough to lose your salvation. Of course, this is not a license to sin (Rom 6:1-2), but then again, if Christ is your Lord, you don't think it is. If you have these fears, remain in God's Word; there are many, many assurances of your stable position there (start with the verses mentioned above). Remain in prayer, God's Holy Spirit will bear witness with your spirit as to your security. Remain in fellowship with other believers; God will comfort and assure you through that fellowship.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years, I've heard people point to a few verses to justify the idea that salvation can be lost. I want to discuss a few of them.
</p>
<p>
1 Cor 15:2 - Those who look at the phrase ”unless you believed in vain” and say that this shows you can lose your salvation are twisting the clear meaning of this phrase into knots. This phrase speaks of persons whose mouth has said ”I believe in Jesus“ without a heart to match. Such a ”belief” is not saving faith. James 2:19 points out that demons believe in God, but clearly, their belief does not come with submission to God; they believe, but they are not saved.
</p>
<p>
2 Cor 13:5 - ”Examine yourself as to whether or not you are in the faith." Again, this speaks to one who professes faith without submission to Jesus' lordship, and no change of heart.
</p>
<p>
Phil 2:12 and the argument ”if you have to work out your own salvation, you can lose it.“ This verse is not speaking of obtaining salvation by your own work - that cannot be done. This verse is explaining that we have a part in our sanctification. We cannot attain holiness if we are pursuing sin; our part is to submit to God and resist sin (James 4:7-8). The “fear and trembling'' spoken of in the verse is the holy reverence and respect of God; it is not the type of fear and trembling experienced, say, when you come face-to-face with a rattlesnake.
</p>
<p>
Col 1:23 - “if indeed you continue ... and are not moved away ...” The Christian who is one in his heart and not only his lips views this verse as an encouragement in the faith in which he is already firm. If this verse makes you nervous, you may want to check your heart and your true allegiance (2 Cor 13:5).
</p>
<p>
Heb 3:12-18 - Frankly, using this scripture to say that salvation can be lost confuses me. The writer says outright in verse 12, “Beware ... lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief” and in verse 13, “lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”
</p>
<p>
2 Pet 1:10 - see comments above for 2 Cor 13:5. Also read verses 5-9 just prior to verse 10.
</p>
<p>
1 John 2:28 - Like Col 1:23, this verse is an encouragement to the faithful Christian and a threat to one looking for an excuse to assert his allegiance to sin.
</p>
<p>
1 John 8-9 - Everything I said for 2 Cor 13:5 and Col 1:23, copy here.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
There is much more that could be said about salvation - like I said, salvation is a large term. If you have a hunger to know more of what God has for you, then take these notes as a starting point for further study. Search the Scriptures and let the Holy Spirit open your understanding. May God draw you, encourage you and enrich you.
