<h3>“... you, who were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works …” <i>(Col 1:21)</i></h3>
<p>
What an on-point description of where I was. Not only me, but anyone who is being honest must acknowledge that. If you spout the lie that you've ”always loved God,” you are lying to yourself in a very severe way. Don't take my word about it - read 1 John 1:8, and keep in mind that John wrote these words in the present tense (“we have”, not “we had”). We all - ALL - have been foolish enough to despise God in the past. If you have acknowledged Christ as your Savior, and do not realize that your thoughts were dark at one time, then I ask you - what did Christ save you from? You were a sinner! (still are, but I'll say more on that later) You were anti-God! Whether you admit it or not, you were delivered from sin, which held you closely. Now if you are in Christ, praise Him that this is no longer true. And have compassion for the unsaved who still think that sin is some kind of fun or some kind of desirable thing. The Bible calls them foolish (Psa 14:1, Prov 12:15), and you should be fervently praying that God's Spirit opens their eyes to their foolishness. You should also be praying that His Holy Spirit lead and empower you to present the Gospel to the perishing.
