In the 1960s, Levine, Nj√•stad and other writers introduced semi-open sets, semi-continuity, nearly open sets and other variations of open sets and consequences of these sets. This expansion of openness continues to the present day. I've found these ideas interesting and thought they may also interest mathematicians who've had a standard first course in topology and thought the point-set development was "fun".

As far as I know, however, these ideas are scattered among numerous papers in numerous journals written from the 1960s onward. This site may not have every result available, but I hope it serves as a repository and useful starting point.
