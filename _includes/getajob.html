<h1>Do You Want Me To Work For You??...</h1>
If you have hiring influence, I hope to impress you with this site.  I need to have you see my work because, frankly, your HR screeners probably won't give you my resume.  You see, I last wrote programs as my primary paid job in 1996.  The reasons why involve some stupid moves on my part, and if we meet, I'll go into why.  While I wasn't working in IT, though, I was not asleep; I still coded, my mindset was still that of a programmer, and I still had skills.  In fact, I still code, and I am still one of the best programmers you will ever meet.  One of the reasons for this site is to prove this.
